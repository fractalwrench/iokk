# International Obfuscated Kotlin Contest

Do you have a coworker who writes the most incomprehensible Kotlin code you've ever seen? Have you inherited such an utter mess of a codebase that it deserves its [very own Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undeciphered_writing_systems)? Then this repository is for you! 

The aim of this contest is to pass the tests for each challenge, by writing the most convoluted Kotlin programs possible.

## An example

For example, consider this innocent Hello World program:

```
println("Hello World")
```

Wouldn't you have more job security if all your pull requests looked more like this?

```
val `_^`: Byte = 27
val `)`: Byte = (11.1 * 10).toByte()
val WAT = byteArrayOf(72, 101, 54 * 2, (`_^` * 4).toByte(), `)`, 44, 32, 87, `)`, 114, 27 * 4, 100, 33)
println(String(WAT))
```

Obviously, that is just an example. Real submissions should be much, much more incomprehensible.

## Submitting a solution

Fork the repository, [read the current challenge](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com.fractalwrench.iokk/n01/n01HelloWorld.kt), and pass the tests with your obfuscated code. 

When you're happy with your solution, open a PR with a **copy** of the file, with your GitHub username as a suffix for the file, class, and method names. For example, `n01HelloWorld` would become `n01HelloWorld_<username>`.

Please document how your monstrosity works using KDoc. An example of a submission is shown [here](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com.fractalwrench.iokk/n01/n01HelloWorld_fractalwrench.kt).

## Judging

After around a month has passed, submissions will be closed, and the top entries will make it into the [Hall of Infamy](#hall-of-infamy).

Points will be given for:

- Degree of incomprehensibility, measured in WTFs/min
- Abuse of language features specific to Kotlin, such as extension functions and operator overloads
- Originality and other clever hacks

After judging, the next challenge will then be opened for submissions. Stay tuned by watching the GitHub repository, as a [new release](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/releases) will be used to notify everyone. 

## Improving the contest

Open an issue if you have a suggestion for a new challenge, or think the contest could be better by changing something.

It's early days and I'm open to ideas.
