# Challenge 01 - Hello World

A quick recap on the rules is available [here](README.md). For the unfamiliar, the aim of the game is to write a Kotlin program that solves a relatively trivial problem, using the most convoluted solution possible.

For this challenge, the program should write the string 'Hello, World!\n' to System.out. In unobfuscated Kotlin, the solution would look something like this:

```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Entries

We received 5 great entries for this challenge, and all the authors have been added to [the Hall of Infamy](README.md#hall-of-infamy). Without further ado, here are the entries, and an attempt to explain how on earth they work.

### Kotlin DSL for Brainfuck

Our first entry is a [Kotlin DSL for Brainfuck](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/pull/5), written by [westonal](https://github.com/westonal).

<!-- TODO -->

### Emojiianal abuse

The [next entry](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/pull/3) by [Naaate](https://github.com/Naaate) makes great use of Unicode emoji, which can form valid Kotlin identifiers.

<!-- TODO -->

### Syntax Inversion

[This entry](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/pull/1) by [swankjesse](https://github.com/swankjesse) flips the syntax of Kotlin on its head, by passing the argument first and method name last.

<!-- TODO -->

### More parentheses than Lisp
[This entry](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/pull/4) by [machtelik](https://github.com/machtelik) uses more parentheses than the average Lisp program, if such a thing is possible.

<!-- TODO -->

### Operator overloading, extension functions, ASCII

Our [last entry](https://github.com/fractalwrench/iokk/pull/2) by [jamiesanson](https://github.com/jamiesanson) abuses extension functions, operator overloading, and ASCII codes to achieve its goal.

<!-- TODO -->

## Next Challenge

Ready for the next challenge? You can check out the entries or get started on submitting a solution [here](CH2.md).

Open an issue if you have a suggestion for a new challenge, or think the contest could be better by changing something.

It's early days and I'm open to ideas.
